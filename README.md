# PriceTracker
---
This project is driven by the decentralised web 3.0 approach to track prices of products from any website, requested by the users of this service.
---

## How can you use this?

- You can open [the website](), and view all the products we are currently tracking.
- You can view bestsellers, biggest price drops of the products on the website.
- You can contribute to track list by logging in and posting the product's url to start tracking.
- You can opt in for notifications via email, sms, whatsApp, telegram; whenever your target price is reached.
- You can view the graphical visualisations of the price changes of the product being tracked.
- You can use the very user friendly interface to easily access the aforementioned features.

## Working
***

### Tech Domain
 - Django REST Framework for handling API.
 - Django rest durin for authentication.
 - Heroku for deployment
 - PostgreSQL Database
 - BeautifulSoup4 for WebScraping 
 - React.JS, TypeScript, Mantine CSS Framework for react
 - Vite.js for compiling frontend react elements.

### How the project works?
1. The backend is built using django to manage all API calls; Database used is PostgreSQL; frontend is made using React.JS
2. The users can log into their accounts and add products to be tracked.
3. Each active user (Node) will be implicitly tracking the products in the background and share the details on the network.
4. These nodes connect and communicate with each other to maintain a ledger of products.
5. These products are thus tracked without the help from main server, reducing the operating costs and legal liabilities or any other hassles.
6. Therefore, this projects transpires a decentralised web 3.0 architecture.

### why a centralised system won't work?
- Most commonly used servers are blacklisted by e-commerce websites to prevent scraping or tracking of products, so continuous tracking of products is hard to implement.
- Cloundflare, a leading security firewall prevents us from accesing the product url.
- But, if user pings the product and shares the details among his peers on the network, the websites will not be able to blacklist them as it would lead to loss of business.
